### The Problem
The taxpayer owed the IRS over **$100,000** in back taxes, interest, and penalties from three unfiled tax years. The IRS was threatening a levy on their bank accounts.

### The Strategy
We performed a detailed financial analysis based on **IRC § 7122**. By applying the specific "Doubt as to Collectibility" standards, we identified that the taxpayer's Reasonable Collection Potential (RCP) was significantly lower than the total debt.

### The Execution
Using **IRM 5.15.1**, we successfully argued for the inclusion of housing and utility allowances that the initial IRS examiner had overlooked. 

### The Result
* **Original Debt:** $102,450
* **Settlement Amount:** $17,450
* **Total Savings:** $85,000
