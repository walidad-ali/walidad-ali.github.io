# Bridging Tax Expertise with Software Innovation

I am a licensed CPA with a passion for building 21st-century tax solutions. My career is defined by a unique dual focus: mastering the complexities of the internal revenue code while developing the software tools necessary to automate and scale those processes.

### Professional Background
With a foundation in traditional accounting and tax strategy, I have pivoted toward the technical side of the industry. I specialize in:

* **IRS API Integration:** Developing secure A2A and ISP flows for the Transcript Delivery System (TDS).
* **Tax Automation:** Building custom workflows that reduce manual data entry and increase filing accuracy.
* **Consulting:** Helping tech-forward businesses navigate the intersection of tax compliance and software architecture.

### My Philosophy
I believe that the future of accounting isn't just about understanding the law—it's about building the infrastructure that makes compliance seamless. Whether I'm filing a return or push-committing code to an API integration, my goal is to provide clarity and efficiency in an increasingly digital world.
